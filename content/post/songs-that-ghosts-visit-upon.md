One of the fascinating creations of music is its ability to conjure memory and emotion despite the song having no connection to memory.

The instigating songs do not need to be from the past. A new song (Frank Ocean, SZA, Moses Sumney, Tame Impala) can will those same ideas, ghosts and emotions into existence that the songs involved in the actual memory creation can do.

That's what these songs do to me.

When they arrive they make me still and I'm transported in time. And just soon as they arrive, they end, and I am returned from that imperceptible wander in time, unimaginably changed from the experience.
